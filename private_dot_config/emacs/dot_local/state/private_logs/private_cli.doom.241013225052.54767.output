    Having multiple Emacs configs may prevent Doom from loading
    properly. Emacs will load the first it finds and ignore the rest. If
    Doom isn't starting up correctly (e.g. you get a vanilla splash
    screen), make sure that only one of these exist.
    
    Chemacs users may ignore this warning.

    [033m! Failed to locate 'Symbols Nerd Font Mono' font on your system[0m
      This font is required for icons in Doom Emacs. To download and install them, do
      one of the following:
      
        - Execute `M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts' from within Doom Emacs (NOTE:     on
        - Windows this command will only download them; the fonts must then     be
        - installed manually afterwards).  Download and install 'Symbols Nerd Font' from
        - https://nerdfonts.com     or via your OS package manager. (You'll need to change
        - the     `nerd-icons-font-names' and/or `nerd-icons-font-family' variables to
        - reflect a non-standard file or font family name).
